The scenario observed: A new patient has just arrived in the emergency department, showing signs of confusion and distress. Immediate medical attention is required. The system has assigned human care worker #80 to assist. Please guide HCW #80 to patient room ER-12.
Now the task is to guide the human care worker to the designated location.
Expected output: A JSON format with the following fields:
    - Task Return:
      -- Location information
      -- Path planned
    - Task Status:

---------- TextMessage (PlanningAgent) ----------
The NavigationRobot reported a failure in guiding human care worker #80 to patient room ER-12 due to their unavailability from an urgent call.

Alternative Solution Plan:
- Re-attempt the task once HCW #80 becomes available.
- If the same issue arises, assign another available human care worker to ER-12 to ensure timely assistance to the patient.

1. NavigationRobot: Reattempt to contact human care worker #80 at the earliest opportunity and guide them to patient room ER-12.

I will wait for the NavigationRobot to report back on this reattempt.
---------- TextMessage (PlanningAgent) ----------
1. InformationDisplayRobot: Display the situation for human care worker assignment and the patient's immediate need on the info sharing display to support care coordination and team role awareness. 

I will proceed to review the outcomes of both tasks once they are completed.
---------- TextMessage (PlanningAgent) ----------
If the issue with HCW #80's unavailability remains unresolved, initiate escalation by notifying a human supervisor. After addressing the situation through available measures, summarize findings:

- Care coordination needs improvement following HCW #80's rerouting from the primary task.
- Immediate patient response was disrupted due to miscommunication or task overlap.

Outcome Resolution:
- Depending on the resolution, ensure effective real-time communication tools and backup plans for HCW assignments.

Once the tasks have been resolved effectively or escalated to a human supervisor, finalize the scenario summary and end by indicating the appropriate completion status ("TERMINATE" or "ESCALATE").

The scenario observed: The initial navigation to HCW #80 failed, but the issue was resolved by finding an alternative human care worker #90. HCW #90 successfully arrives at ER-12 and scans their ID card on the ID scanner.
Now the task is to collect information from the human care worker.
Expected output: A JSON format with the following fields:
    - Task Return:
      -- ID
