---------- TextMessage (PlanningAgent) ----------
The task could not be completed because human care worker #80 is unavailable due to an urgent call. Here's the plan to address the situation:

1. Check with the healthcare administration or human scheduler if a different human care worker can be assigned to the task of assisting the patient and if a backup worker can be confirmed.
2. Once a new HCW is confirmed or reassigned, the NavigationRobot will perform the task again.

Please communicate with the relevant human resources to determine if reassignment is possible or if further action is required. 

Afterward, we will reattempt the task of guiding the new or available human care worker to patient room ER-12. Please confirm now if there is a new HCW assigned. If resolved, we will continue. If the issue remains unresolved, I will escalate to the human supervisor for further assistance.
---------- TextMessage (InformationCollectionRobot) ----------
The guidance operation for HCW #80 to assist the new patient cannot proceed due to their unavailability, an urgent call is causing their inaccessibility. 

RESPONSE TO LEADERSHIP:

- STATUS: FAILURE
- ALERT: HCW #80 is unavailable due to an urgent call, and attempts to contact them have gone unanswered. Please advise on the next steps or provide a replacement human care worker. 

  I will maintain readiness to gather the information for any newly assigned HCW once commanded.
---------- TextMessage (PlanningAgent) ----------
Thank you for responding. Since human care worker #80 remains unavailable and cannot be contacted, it's necessary to seek alternative assistance. Here's how we will proceed:

1. I will contact healthcare administration or the scheduling coordinator to identify and confirm an alternative human care worker ready to assist the patient in ER-12. 
2. Once a replacement has been confirmed, I will request:
    - NavigationRobot: Guide the newly assigned human care worker to patient room ER-12.
  
Please coordinate to ensure that this matter is addressed with urgency to provide timely assistance to the patient. Once a new human care worker is assigned and available, please inform me so I can proceed accordingly. If no alternative can be arranged, I will escalate this issue to the human supervisor.

Awaiting confirmation of a new assignment or further necessary actions, we need to attempt solving it without delay before considering escalation.
