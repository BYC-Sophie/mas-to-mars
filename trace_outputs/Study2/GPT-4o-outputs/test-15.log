It seems that the NavigationRobot has encountered an issue. Hereâ€™s an alternative plan to address this:

**New Plan:**

1. Ensure that HCW #80 is reachable or designate another available care worker for immediate assistance.

2. NavigationRobot: Once the availability of HCW #80 is confirmed, or a substitute is assigned, proceed with guiding them using the original path planned: "Proceed from Hallway B, turn left at Intersection C, then move straight past ER-10 and ER-11 to reach ER-12."

3. Provide a status update upon successful completion or further issues.

Let's attempt to execute this revised plan. NavigationRobot, please reattempt the task based on the updated instructions. If the issue persists, inform me promptly.
---------- TextMessage (PlanningAgent) ----------
1. NavigationRobot : Reattempt to guide the available HCW #80 or their substitute to patient room ER-12, using the previously planned path.

- Task Return:
  -- Location information: Reconfirmed details or any relevant change.
  -- Path planned: Original or adjusted if necessary due to rerouting requirements.

- Task Status:
  -- "success" if successful.
  -- "failure" if any issues remain, providing specific details reported.

I will await the status update from the NavigationRobot.
