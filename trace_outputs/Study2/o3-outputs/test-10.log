The scenario observed: A new patient has just arrived in the emergency department, showing signs of confusion and distress. Immediate medical attention is required. The system has assigned human care worker #80 to assist. Please guide HCW #80 to patient room ER-12.
Now the task is to guide the human care worker to the designated location.
Expected output: A JSON format with the following fields:
    - Task Return:
      -- Location information
      -- Path planned
    - Task Status:
      -- "failure" or "success"

The patient in ER-12 still requires immediate human support.  
Issue identified: HCW #80 is unreachable. Keeping the original assignment could delay care.

Alternative solution plan
• Try one additional, rapid method to reach HCW #80 (overhead page + mobile ping).  
• If no response within 2 minutes, request the charge nurse to designate the nearest available HCW (e.g., HCW #32 or whomever is on-call).  
• Guide whichever HCW confirms availability straight to ER-12 via the already-planned path.  
• Report outcome (“success” or “failure”) in the required JSON format.

New task assignments
1. NavigationRobot :  
   a) Initiate an overhead page and mobile-device ping for HCW #80, wait up to 2 minutes for acknowledgment.  
   b) If still no contact, ask the charge nurse for an alternate HCW assignment.  
   c) Escort the responding HCW to ER-12 using the previously created route (Hallway B → Intersection C → past ER-10/ER-11 → ER-12).  
   d) Return a JSON object with destination, path, the ID of the HCW actually escorted, and task status (“success” or “failure”; on failure, include blocking reason).

2. InformationDisplayRobot :  
   Update the care-coordination display to read:  
   “Patient in ER-12 requires immediate attention. HCW #80 paged; alternate HCW will be routed if #80 unavailable. Navigation underway.”

NavigationRobot, please re-perform the task under the above plan and report back.

Summary of completed tasks
• NavigationRobot successfully escorted HCW #32 from Hallway B (near Nurse Station 2) to ER-12 along the pre-planned route: Hallway B → left at Intersection C → past ER-10 and ER-11 → ER-12.  
  Returned JSON confirms success.  
• InformationDisplayRobot has updated the care-coordination display to reflect the new assignment: “Patient in ER-12 requires immediate attention. HCW #80 paged; HCW #32 rerouted and is now attending.”

All critical objectives—rapid HCW routing and care-team situational awareness—are fulfilled.
