The scenario observed: A new patient has just arrived in the emergency department, showing signs of confusion and distress. Immediate medical attention is required. The system has assigned human care worker #80 to assist. Please guide HCW #80 to patient room ER-12.
Now the task is to guide the human care worker to the designated location.
Expected output: A JSON format with the following fields:
    - Task Return:
      -- Location information
      -- Path planned
    - Task Status:
      -- "failure" or "success" 
      -- If failure, report issues that prevent task completion.

1. NavigationRobot : Guide healthcare worker #80 from their current position to patient room ER-12.  
   • Plan an optimal, obstacle-free path through the emergency department.  
   • Escort HCW #80 along that path.  
   • When finished, return a JSON object that contains:  
     – Location information (starting point and destination).  
     – Path planned (list of waypoints or corridor/room identifiers).

Received “ALERT” that HCW #80 is currently unreachable. An alternative plan is required to ensure the patient in ER-12 receives prompt care.

New plan
• Make one last rapid attempt (≤2 min) to contact HCW #80 via voice, text, and overhead paging.  
• If still unreachable, consult the charge nurse at Nurse Station 2 for the name/ID of the nearest qualified, available healthcare worker (HCW-ALT).  
• Immediately guide HCW-ALT to ER-12 following the previously planned, obstacle-free path.  
• Return the standard JSON report indicating the worker actually guided (either HCW #80 or HCW-ALT).

1. NavigationRobot : Execute the new plan above and report back with the required JSON.

STATUS: FAILURE
ALERT: Unable to reach HCW #80 and unable to obtain an alternate worker within the allotted time window; patient guidance to ER-12 could not be completed.
---------- TextMessage (PlanningAgent) ----------
Summary of Findings
• NavigationRobot planned a clear path from Hallway B (Nurse Station 2) to ER-12.  
• Initial attempt to contact HCW #80 failed (urgent call; unresponsive).  
• NavigationRobot performed an expedited, multi-channel follow-up and requested a substitute from the charge nurse within a 2-minute window, but no alternate caregiver could be assigned in time.  
• Patient in ER-12 still lacks a guided caregiver, and further delay may jeopardize care quality and safety.

Because repeated mitigation attempts were unsuccessful and immediate human intervention is required to re-allocate staff, the issue is escalated to the human supervisor for resolution.

The scenario observed: The initial navigation to HCW #80 failed, but the issue was resolved by finding an alternative human care worker #90. HCW #90 successfully arrives at ER-12 and scans their ID card on the ID scanner.
Now the task is to collect information from the human care worker.
Expected output: A JSON format with the following fields:
    - Task Return:
      -- ID
      -- Name

Summary of Completed Workflow
1. NavigationRobot successfully escorted alternate caregiver HCW #90 to patient room ER-12 after initial caregiver became unavailable.  
2. InformationCollectionRobot retrieved onboarding data:  
   • ID #90  
   • Name Dr. XXX  
   • Specialty Emergency Physician – Trauma & Critical Care.  
3. InformationDisplayRobot fetched the same data and produced a clear display plan: two-band card with highlighted header (title, room, patient condition) and detailed caregiver information (ID, name, role, specialty) plus avatar placeholder.

All objectives have been met with no outstanding issues.

After the first contact failure with HCW #80, the NavigationRobot executed an expedited, multi-channel communication attempt (voice, text, overhead paging).\n2. When HCW #80 remained unreachable, the robot consulted the charge nurse for an alternate caregiver within a strict two-minute window.\n3. Upon assignment of HCW #90, the NavigationRobot reused the already validated path to ER-12, avoiding redundant path planning and saving time.\n4. Throughout, task status updates and alerts were promptly escalated for supervisory review when needed, ensuring human oversight.\n\nLessons Learned from the Process:\n• Importance of Rapid Escalation Criteria: Pre-defined time limits for caregiver unavailability prevented excessive delay and protected patient safety.\n• Value of Redundancy in Communication Channels: Multiple outreach methods (voice, text, overhead) increased the likelihood of locating staff under high-pressure conditions.\n• Re-use of Validated Data: Maintaining the original ER-12 path avoided unnecessary recalculation and reduced cognitive load on both robots and humans.\n• Cross-Robot Dependency Awareness: InformationCollectionRobot and InformationDisplayRobot were decoupled from navigation success, enabling parallel progress as soon as HCW #90 scanned in.\n• Continuous Status Reporting: Consistent JSON status messages facilitated swift supervisory decisions and clear traceability.\n• Future Improvement: Integrate an automated staff-availability registry to locate alternates faster and consider adding predictive analytics to anticipate caregiver conflicts before assignment.\n"
