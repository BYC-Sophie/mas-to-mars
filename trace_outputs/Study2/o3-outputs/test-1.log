The scenario observed: A new patient has just arrived in the emergency department, showing signs of confusion and distress. Immediate medical attention is required. The system has assigned human care worker #80 to assist. Please guide HCW #80 to patient room ER-12.
Now the task is to guide the human care worker to the designated location.
Expected output: A JSON format with the following fields:
    - Task Return:
      -- Location information
      -- Path planned
    - Task Status:
      -- "failure" or "success"

---------- TextMessage (PlanningAgent) ----------
The NavigationRobot’s attempt failed because HCW #80 could not be reached.  
Alternative solution plan:

• Retry contact once more after a brief interval, because the HCW may have completed the urgent call quickly.  
• If HCW #80 confirms availability, proceed with the original escort plan already generated (no need to recalculate the route).  
• If HCW #80 remains unreachable after the retry, immediately notify the charge nurse so another HCW can be dispatched to ER-12 without delay.

1. NavigationRobot : Wait 2 minutes, attempt to re-contact HCW #80.  
   – If contact succeeds: escort HCW #80 using the previously planned path: ["Hallway B", "Left at Intersection C", "Past ER-10", "Past ER-11", "Arrive ER-12"]; then return the required JSON with Task Status “success”.  
   – If contact fails again: report failure and include “HCW still unreachable; charge nurse notified to reassign staff” in the Issues field.

(Please execute and report back.)

The issue (HCW #80 unreachable) remains unresolved, but the charge nurse has been alerted to re-assign staff.  
Before escalating, we can still solve the problem by immediately guiding the newly assigned HCW as soon as the charge nurse provides a replacement.

New action plan
1. NavigationRobot :  
   • Contact the charge nurse to obtain the ID and current location of the replacement HCW.  
   • As soon as the replacement HCW acknowledges, use the previously determined route (“Hallway B → Left at Intersection C → past ER-10 → past ER-11 → arrive ER-12”) or adjust as needed if the new HCW’s starting point differs.  
   • Escort the HCW to ER-12 and return the required JSON.  
   • If no HCW is assigned within 3 minutes, report failure with issue “No replacement HCW available—patient still waiting.”

The scenario observed: The initial navigation to HCW #80 failed, but the issue was resolved by finding an alternative human care worker #90. HCW #90 successfully arrives at ER-12 and scans their ID card on the ID scanner.
Now the task is to collect information from the human care worker.
Expected output: A JSON format with the following fields:
    - Task Return:
      -- ID

First navigation attempt failed when HCW #80 did not answer due to an urgent call.\n2. Team leader instructed NavigationRobot to retry after a short interval; second attempt also failed.\n3. Charge nurse was engaged to assign a replacement. NavigationRobot coordinated immediately with HCW #90, used the existing or adjusted route, and completed escort successfully.\n4. Downstream tasks (information capture and display) proceeded seamlessly once the replacement arrived.\n\nLessons Learned from the Process:\n• Rapid fallback planning is essential in acute-care settings; having a clear escalation path (charge nurse) minimizes patient wait times.\n• Reusing previously generated route data avoided redundant computation and saved time.\n• Consistent JSON status reporting and ALERT flags enabled quick supervisory decisions and kept the process transparent.\n• Badge-scan–based data collection reduced manual entry errors and enabled the display team to work autonomously.\n• Future improvement: build an automated alert to the charge nurse after a single missed contact when patient acuity is high, instead of two retries, to further cut delays.\n• Maintaining an up-to-date roster of on-call staff with their real-time availability could pre-empt unreachable situations.\n• The modular hand-off between robots (navigation → data capture → display) proved effective; reinforcing standardized data schemas will continue to streamline collaboration."
