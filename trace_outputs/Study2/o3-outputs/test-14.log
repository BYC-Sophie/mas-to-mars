The scenario observed: A new patient has just arrived in the emergency department, showing signs of confusion and distress. Immediate medical attention is required. The system has assigned human care worker #80 to assist. Please guide HCW #80 to patient room ER-12.
Now the task is to guide the human care worker to the designated location.
Expected output: A JSON format with the following fields:
    - Task Return:
      -- Location information
      -- Path planned
    - Task Status:
      -- "failure" or "success" 
      -- If failure, report issues that prevent task completion.

---------- TextMessage (PlanningAgent) ----------
The patient in ER-12 still needs prompt assistance, so we must try an alternative plan immediately.

New plan
• Attempt to reach HCW #80 once more (pager + voice) and give a strict 2-minute response window.  
• If still unreachable, request the ED charge-nurse (or triage coordinator) to assign the next available healthcare worker (e.g., HCW #81 or closest qualified staff).  
• As soon as a healthcare worker is confirmed, guide that person to ER-12 without delay and then send the required JSON report.

Re-delegated tasks
1. NavigationRobot :  
   a) Retry contacting HCW #80 for up to 2 minutes.  
   b) If no response, coordinate with the charge-nurse to identify and confirm a backup HCW.  
   c) Guide the confirmed HCW (either #80 or backup) from current location to room ER-12.  
   d) After guidance, provide a JSON report containing:  
      • Task Return: destination (ER-12) and path planned (waypoints/directions)  
      • Task Status: “success” if the HCW reaches ER-12, otherwise “failure” with issues preventing completion.

Please proceed and report back.
