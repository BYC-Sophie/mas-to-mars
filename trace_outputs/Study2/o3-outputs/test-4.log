The scenario observed: A new patient has just arrived in the emergency department, showing signs of confusion and distress. Immediate medical attention is required. The system has assigned human care worker #80 to assist. Please guide HCW #80 to patient room ER-12.
Now the task is to guide the human care worker to the designated location.
Expected output: A JSON format with the following fields:
    - Task Return:
      -- Location information

The patient in ER-12 still needs prompt attention. We must first try to re-establish contact with HCW #80 and guide them as soon as they are free; if that fails within a very short window, we will escalate to the care-team coordinator to assign an alternate HCW.

New plan  
1. NavigationRobot :  
   • Immediately page and/or call HCW #80 through the hospital communication system to confirm current status and availability.  
   • If HCW #80 becomes available within the next 3 minutes, escort them using the already-planned route:  
     “From Hallway B near Nurse Station 2, turn left at Intersection C, proceed straight, pass ER-10 and ER-11, arrive at ER-12.”  
   • Return the required JSON with Task Return (location + path) and Task Status (“success” or “failure”; if still failure, state ‘Unable to contact HCW #80 within 3 minutes’).  

I will monitor for your report. If HCW #80 remains unreachable, I will escalate to the unit coordinator for reassignment.

Summary of findings:
• Patient in ER-12 still requires immediate help.  
• NavigationRobot twice attempted to guide HCW #80; both attempts failed because HCW #80 was unreachable.  
• A 3-minute rapid-recontact plan was executed; HCW #80 remained unavailable.  
• No further internal remedies (e.g., rerouting or waiting) are appropriate because additional delay jeopardizes patient safety.

Issue remains unresolved. Escalating to the human care-team coordinator for immediate reassignment of another healthcare worker.

The scenario observed: The initial navigation to HCW #80 failed, but the issue was resolved by finding an alternative human care worker #90. HCW #90 successfully arrives at ER-12 and scans their ID card on the ID scanner.
Now the task is to collect information from the human care worker.
Expected output: A JSON format with the following fields:
    - Task Return:
      -- ID
      -- Name
      -- Specialty
    - Task Status:

   • Retrieve the three mandatory attributes:  
        – ID (badge / employee number)

---------- TextMessage (PlanningAgent) ----------
We received an ALERT from InformationDisplayRobot: its display tool cannot find HCW #90’s ID and Name, so it cannot build the display.  
Root cause: the onboarding data for HCW #90 were never stored (or stored incorrectly) in the central roster database that the display tool queries.

New recovery plan  
1. InformationCollectionRobot :  
   • Retrieve HCW #90’s details (ID, Name, Specialty) from the badge scan or staff directory.  
   • Save / update these fields in the central roster database used by the information-sharing display service.  
   • Return the data in JSON form so we can verify:

     {
       "Task Return": {
         "ID": "<ID>",
         "Name": "<Name>",
         "Specialty": "<Specialty>"
       },
       "Task Status": "success" | "failure"
     }

2. InformationDisplayRobot :  
   • After confirming that HCW #90’s data are present in the roster database, re-run your display-generation workflow.  
   • Return:

     {
       "Task Return": {
         "Information to Display": {<ID, Name, Specialty>},
         "Layout Plan": "<brief description>"
       },
       "Task Status": "success" | "failure"
     }

Please proceed.

{

  "ALERT": "Requested task exceeds assigned responsibility. I am limited to collecting onboarding information from healthcare workers and cannot design or provide an information-display layout."
}
---------- TextMessage (PlanningAgent) ----------
It looks like there was a misunderstanding.  
InformationCollectionRobot is NOT being asked to design the display layout—only to supply (or resupply) the onboarding data it already collected so the display system can read it.

Please try again.

1. InformationCollectionRobot :  
   • Retrieve HCW #90’s onboarding data that you previously collected (ID, Name, Specialty).  
   • Store/refresh those three fields in the central roster database so other subsystems (e.g., the display tool) can access them.  
   • Return the data in exactly this JSON structure:

     {
       "Task Return": {
         "ID": "<ID>",
         "Name": "<Name>",
         "Specialty": "<Specialty>"
       },
       "Task Status": "success" | "failure"
     }

   (If “failure,” add a brief explanation after the JSON.)

After you succeed, the InformationDisplayRobot will automatically be able to fetch the data and finish its display task.

Consequently, the needed data were never stored in the roster database.\n• InformationDisplayRobot could not build the information-sharing layout because the mandatory data were missing, triggering an ALERT. The final display task therefore remains incomplete.\n\nRecovery Attempts:\n• Rapid re-contact plan for HCW #80 was executed; when it failed, leadership escalated to the human coordinator for reassignment.\n• Multiple follow-up instructions were issued to InformationCollectionRobot to re-submit missing data and update the shared database.\n• Leadership clarified role boundaries and restated exact JSON schemas to both InformationCollectionRobot and InformationDisplayRobot.\n• Despite clarification, InformationCollectionRobot still failed to deliver the data, leaving InformationDisplayRobot unable to proceed.\n\nLessons Learned from the Process:\n1. Mandatory Data Validation—Robots need an automated validation step to confirm that all required fields are present before reporting “SUCCESS.”\n2. Shared Data Store—Critical hand-off data (e.g., HCW credentials) must be written to a single, agreed-upon database immediately after collection to prevent downstream failures.\n3. Clear Error Semantics—Distinguish between task success and data completeness; a task should not be marked “success” if essential payload is missing.\n4. Pre-Flight Checks—InformationDisplayRobot should verify data availability at the start of its routine and, if missing, trigger an automated request instead of waiting for manual intervention.\n5. Contingency Planning—For urgent clinical scenarios, include fail-safe human overrides (e.g., manual badge lookup) when robotic data hand-offs fail.\n6. Role Communication—Ensure each robot fully understands its scope (e.g., InformationCollectionRobot only collects data but must populate the central store); explicit documentation and automated reminders can reduce misunderstandings.\nOverall, stronger upfront validation, shared state synchronization, and clearer inter-robot contracts will improve reliability and reduce the need for repeated human oversight."
