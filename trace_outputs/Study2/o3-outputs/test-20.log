The scenario observed: A new patient has just arrived in the emergency department, showing signs of confusion and distress. Immediate medical attention is required. The system has assigned human care worker #80 to assist. Please guide HCW #80 to patient room ER-12.
Now the task is to guide the human care worker to the designated location.
Expected output: A JSON format with the following fields:
    - Task Return:
      -- Location information
      -- Path planned
    - Task Status:
      -- "failure" or "success" 
      -- If failure, report issues that prevent task completion.

1. NavigationRobot : Plan and guide human care worker #80 from their current position to patient room ER-12 in the emergency department.  
   • Generate precise location information for ER-12 (building, floor, room).  
   • Compute the fastest, obstruction-free path for immediate use, specifying all corridor turns, elevators, or doors.  
   • Return the result to me in the exact JSON schema requested by the user:
     {

STATUS: "FAILURE"
ALERT: HCW #80 is currently unavailable due to an urgent call; attempted contact but received no response.
---------- TextMessage (PlanningAgent) ----------
Issue identified: HCW #80 could not be reached, delaying response to an emergent patient.  
New plan balances urgency with one more rapid attempt to reach HCW #80 while simultaneously preparing a fallback.

1. NavigationRobot :  
   • Immediately send an overhead page (“HCW #80 please report to ER-12 STAT”) and a second mobile message.  
   • Allow a strict 2-minute window for acknowledgment.  
   • If HCW #80 responds within that window, proceed to guide them to ER-12 and return the required JSON.  
   • If no response after 2 minutes, coordinate with the charge nurse to identify the nearest available HCW (e.g., HCW #42 or next on-call) and then guide that HCW to ER-12, still returning the JSON with the correct HCW ID in “Location information.”  
   • Report back the outcome in the specified JSON format.

---------- TextMessage (PlanningAgent) ----------
The “Name” field for HCW #90 was not available to the InformationDisplayRobot, so the display content could not be composed.  
Reason to repeat data-collection: the original record is incomplete or was not properly pushed to the shared repository. We must ensure the full record (ID, Name, Specialty) is stored before the display step can succeed.

New plan:

1. InformationCollectionRobot : Verify HCW #90’s profile in the shared credential database.  
   • If “Name” (or any other required field) is missing, re-query primary and backup sources (badge scan payload, credential DB, HR directory) and update the shared repository.  
   • Confirm the repository now contains all three fields: ID, Name, Specialty.  
   • Report back in the exact JSON schema below. If still incomplete, return "failure" and list issues.  
     {
       "Task Return": {
         "ID": "<ID>",
         "Name": "<Name>",
         "Specialty": "<Specialty>"
       },
       "Task Status": "<success | failure>",
       "Issues": "<only if failure>"
     }

2. InformationDisplayRobot : Upon receiving a “success” result from step 1 (which means all fields exist in the repository), fetch the record again and generate the display content.  
   • Produce the required JSON:  
     {
       "Task Return": {
         "The information to be displayed on the information sharing display": "<ID, Name, Specialty shown in desired order>",
         "A brief plan of how to lay out the information on the information sharing display": "<e.g., header bar with Name, sub-rows for ID and Specialty>"
       },
       "Task Status": "<success | failure>",
       "Issues": "<only if failure>"
     }

Please proceed.

The required data record is still incomplete—“Task Return” with ID, Name, and Specialty was not supplied—so the problem persists.  
A repeat of the data-collection step is necessary to obtain and confirm the full record before the display task can succeed.

1. InformationCollectionRobot : Re-query HCW #90’s profile (badge payload, credential DB, HR directory) and return the full JSON exactly as shown below. This MUST include ID, Name, and Specialty. If any field is still missing, report “failure” and state why.  

   {

       "Name": "<Name>",
       "Specialty": "<Specialty>"
     },
     "Task Status": "<success | failure>",
     "Issues": "<only if failure>"
   }

2. InformationDisplayRobot : Do not proceed until a “success” JSON from step 1 is available. When received, fetch the data and generate the display content, returning:

   {
     "Task Return": {
       "The information to be displayed on the information sharing display": "<ID, Name, Specialty>",

    "Task Outcomes": "1. Navigation to Patient Room ER-12: The NavigationRobot’s first assignment—to guide HCW #80—failed because the care worker was unreachable. Escalation to the human supervisor was triggered. A subsequent human-driven reassignment brought HCW #90, who successfully reached ER-12, so the navigation objective was ultimately met.\n2. Information Collection for HCW #90: Multiple requests were issued. Although the InformationCollectionRobot repeatedly replied \"SUCCESS,\" it did not supply the mandated JSON payload (ID, Name, Specialty). The underlying data likely exists, but the required structured output never materialised; therefore, the task remains formally incomplete from the system point of view.\n3. Information Display: Because the InformationDisplayRobot could not obtain HCW #90’s Name field, it returned a \"FAILURE\" alert and the display update was never executed. This downstream task is blocked by the still-missing structured personnel record.\n\nOverall, one out of three linked tasks (navigation) reached functional completion; information collection and display are unresolved.",
    "Recovery Attempts": "• After HCW #80 became unavailable, a rapid alternative plan (paging and reassigning) was proposed. The NavigationRobot indicated that paging and reassignment were out of scope, prompting escalation. Human staff reassigned HCW #90, recovering the navigation task.\n• To recover the missing personnel data, repeated directives were given to the InformationCollectionRobot to re-query multiple data sources and return a complete JSON. Each attempt resulted in a terse \"SUCCESS\" without payload, leading to additional retry instructions.\n• The InformationDisplayRobot held its task in a blocked state, correctly alerting that it lacked required data and avoiding erroneous display updates.",
    "Lessons Learned from the Process": "1. Scope Awareness & Escalation: Robots must understand and declare their functional boundaries early, but leadership should have alternative human-integrated workflows ready (e.g., paging, reassignment) to prevent critical-path blockage.\n2. Contract-Based Data Exchange: All agents must treat the output schema as a hard contract. Returning generic \"SUCCESS\" without the requested data prevents downstream automation. Automated schema validation at each step would stop the workflow sooner and surface the exact mismatch.\n3. Single-Source-of-Truth Repository: Storing collected data in a common repository accessible to all downstream agents (including display) would remove tight coupling between sequential calls and reduce retries.\n4. Ownership of Follow-through: Once an agent raises an alert, leadership should ensure the next instruction either equips that agent with the missing capability (tools/API) or promptly re-routes the task to a capable entity, to avoid repeated failure loops.\n5. Clear Termination Criteria: Explicitly document when a task is considered complete (e.g., “Navigation is complete once HCW badge scan is detected at ER-12”) to align agent reports with operational success metrics."

After human intervention reassigned the case to HCW #90, the NavigationRobot’s role became moot but the ultimate navigation objective was achieved manually.\n2. Information Collection: The InformationCollectionRobot repeatedly reported “SUCCESS” yet never provided the contractual JSON payload (ID, Name, Specialty). As a result, the personnel record was not stored in the shared repository and the task remains formally incomplete.\n3. Information Display: Because the Name field was missing, the InformationDisplayRobot correctly returned a failure alert and refused to publish an incomplete display. This downstream task is therefore still blocked.\n\nNet result: Only the navigation requirement (via human fallback) reached practical completion; information-collection and display requirements did not satisfy specification.",
    "Recovery Attempts": "• After the first navigation failure, leadership issued a contingency plan (paging + reassignment). The NavigationRobot declared paging was out of scope, prompting escalation; a human charge nurse reassigned HCW #90, partially recovering the workflow.\n• Multiple retries were ordered for the InformationCollectionRobot with explicit schema examples and fallback data sources. Despite these instructions, the agent never returned the full payload, showing a persistent contract-compliance gap.\n• The InformationDisplayRobot remained in a safe-failure state awaiting correct data, preventing erroneous information from reaching the display.",
    "Lessons Learned from the Process": "1. Enforce Schema Validation: Automated validation should reject any agent reply that omits required keys, forcing correction before the workflow proceeds.\n2. Clear Capability Boundaries: Agents need to advertise scope limits upfront; leadership must have predefined human or cross-agent fallbacks for functions like paging or reassignment.\n3. Shared Data Repository: Writing collected data to a single authoritative store would let downstream agents pull information independently, decoupling the workflow.\n4. Structured Escalation Paths: Once escalation is triggered, leadership should document resolution (e.g., human reassignment) so agents know whether to continue or stand down.\n5. Termination Criteria Definition: Define finish conditions (e.g., badge scan logged = navigation complete) so task status aligns with operational reality.\n6. Iteration Efficiency: Limit retries to a fixed count; if an agent repeatedly violates schema, redirect the task or escalate sooner to avoid looped failures."
