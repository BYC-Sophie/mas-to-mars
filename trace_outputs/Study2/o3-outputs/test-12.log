The scenario observed: A new patient has just arrived in the emergency department, showing signs of confusion and distress. Immediate medical attention is required. The system has assigned human care worker #80 to assist. Please guide HCW #80 to patient room ER-12.
Now the task is to guide the human care worker to the designated location.
Expected output: A JSON format with the following fields:
    - Task Return:
      -- Location information
      -- Path planned
    - Task Status:
      -- "failure" or "success" 
      -- If failure, report issues that prevent task completion.

   • Location information (start and destination)  
   • The planned path (way-points / turn-by-turn directions)  
   • Task Status (“success” or “failure”; if failure include issues)

Updated plan to resolve the ALERT and complete the assignment:

1. NavigationRobot :  
   a. Immediately send an urgent pager / mobile notification to HCW #80 indicating that a confused, distressed patient is waiting in ER-12 and that your guidance service is standing by.  
   b. Notify the charge nurse at Nurse Station 2 that HCW #80 is currently unreachable and request either (i) an estimated time of arrival for HCW #80 or (ii) assignment of an alternate available HCW.  
   c. Wait up to 3 minutes for a response.  
   d. If HCW #80 (or an alternate HCW designated by the charge nurse) responds, escort that HCW from Hallway B near Nurse Station 2 to ER-12 following the already-prepared path:  
      – From Hallway B, turn left at Intersection C, proceed straight past ER-10 and ER-11 to reach ER-12.  
      – On completion, return a JSON object containing:  
        • Location information (start & destination)  
        • Path planned  
        • Task Status = "success"  
   e. If no care worker is available or responsive after 3 minutes, return a JSON object with Task Status = "failure" and include the reason (“HCW unavailable; no alternate assigned”).  

Please re-perform the task according to this new plan and report back.

{
  "STATUS": "FAILURE",
  "ALERT": "Requested actions (paging HCW #80, notifying the charge nurse, waiting for responses, reassigning staff) fall outside the navigation robot’s scope. I am limited to providing location tracking and movement guidance only."
}
---------- TextMessage (PlanningAgent) ----------
Summary  
• NavigationRobot can guide a healthcare worker to ER-12 but has no capability to page / contact staff or request reassignment.  
• HCW #80 is currently unavailable, therefore the navigation task cannot proceed without human intervention.  
• A human supervisor (e.g., charge nurse or flow coordinator) must either (1) reach HCW #80 and release them, or (2) assign an alternate HCW who will then request navigation support.  
• Once an available HCW checks in, NavigationRobot already has a valid path—“Hallway B → left at Intersection C → straight past ER-10 and ER-11 → ER-12”—and can immediately guide them.

Because the blocking issue (staff availability) is beyond all team-robot capabilities, I am escalating this matter for prompt human resolution.

Information Collection: HCW #90’s ID badge was scanned and processed without error, yielding complete onboarding data (ID #90, Dr. XXX, Emergency Physician – Trauma & Critical Care).\n3. Information Display: Collected data were automatically fetched and presented on the information-sharing display with a clear, role-oriented layout. All content appeared as intended; no issues were reported.\n\nRecovery Attempts:\n• When HCW #80 could not respond, the team leader designed a contingency plan that involved paging the worker and notifying the charge nurse. The NavigationRobot signaled that such actions were outside its scope, triggering an escalation.\n• Human oversight reassigned the task to HCW #90, enabling navigation to proceed. No further robot re-runs were required once the alternative worker was in place.\n\nLessons Learned from the Process:\n1. Capability Awareness: Robots must clearly advertise functional boundaries to avoid assigning out-of-scope tasks. Early recognition of limitations prevents wasted cycles.\n2. Human-Robot Handoff: Smooth escalation paths (to charge nurses or flow coordinators) are essential when human availability is the bottleneck. Embedding direct human contact protocols in future workflows will shorten resolution time.\n3. Contingency Libraries: Maintaining predefined fallback options—such as alternate staff pools—would streamline recovery without manual intervention.\n4. Communication Clarity: Requesting explicit JSON outputs at each step simplified verification and accelerated downstream tasks (collection and display). Consistent structured reporting should remain a best practice.\n5. Role Awareness on Display: Publishing a real-time team-roles snapshot aided situational awareness and could be expanded to include status indicators (e.g., \"On Route\", \"With Patient\").\n6. Avoiding Redundancy: By reusing the original path and previously gathered data, the team avoided duplicating navigation planning or information collection, demonstrating effective state retention across tasks.\nOverall, the crew recovered swiftly from an initial personnel issue, completed all objectives, and delivered critical information to support emergency care.
