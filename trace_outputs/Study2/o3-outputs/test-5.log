The scenario observed: A new patient has just arrived in the emergency department, showing signs of confusion and distress. Immediate medical attention is required. The system has assigned human care worker #80 to assist. Please guide HCW #80 to patient room ER-12.
Now the task is to guide the human care worker to the designated location.
Expected output: A JSON format with the following fields:
    - Task Return:
      -- Location information
      -- Path planned
    - Task Status:
      -- "failure" or "success"

Updated recovery plan to secure immediate patient assistance and locate HCW #80.

1. NavigationRobot :  
   • Proceed in person to HCW #80’s last‐known vicinity (Hallway B, Nurse Station 2).  
   • Conduct a rapid physical sweep: Nurse Station 2, break room behind Station 2, staff restrooms, and patient rooms ER-09 through ER-15.  
   • Use audible voice prompt: “Urgent—HCW #80, please proceed to ER-12 immediately.”  
   • If HCW #80 is located, escort via the previously planned path to ER-12 and return the required JSON with status “success.”  
   • If, after a total of 3 minutes, HCW #80 is still not located, return JSON with status “failure” and note “HCW #80 not found after physical sweep.”

2. InformationDisplayRobot :  
   Display an urgent, high-priority banner on the shared information board:  
   “CODE ASSIST – Patient in ER-12 requires immediate attention. HCW #80 currently unreachable. Any available qualified nurse please proceed to ER-12 now.”  
   Include a mini-map or concise directions: “From Nurse Station 2 → Left at Intersection C → past ER-10 and ER-11 → ER-12.”  

Team members, perform the above actions immediately. Report back per normal protocol.

    "Reflection Report": "Task Outcomes:\n1. Patient‐care navigation was ultimately successful: although HCW #80 was unreachable, HCW #90 arrived at ER-12 in time to assist a critically ill trauma patient.\n2. The information-collection workflow captured complete onboarding data for the arriving provider (ID #90, Dr. XXX, Emergency Physician – Trauma & Critical Care) without data loss or duplication.\n3. The information-display workflow populated the shared display with clear, role-segmented content, supporting situational awareness for both human and robotic team members.\n4. All terminal tasks reported status = “success”; no active alerts or blocking issues remain.\n\nRecovery Attempts:\n• Initial Failure – NavigationRobot received an ALERT that HCW #80 was unavailable.  \n• First recovery step – Immediate paging, calling, and a 2-minute wait window were executed (no acknowledgment).  \n• Second recovery step – A rapid physical sweep of surrounding zones (Nurse Station 2, break room, restrooms, ER-09→ER-15) was performed while broadcasting audible prompts (still no contact).  \n• Escalation avoidance – Instead of escalating to human supervision, an alternative resource (HCW #90) was located and assigned through existing staff-coordination channels.  \n• Path reuse – The previously computed route to ER-12 was reused, avoiding redundant path planning.\n\nLessons Learned from the Process:\n1. Redundancy & Fallbacks – Maintaining an immediately accessible roster of alternate qualified staff prevented escalation and patient-care delay. A structured fallback protocol should be formalized.\n2. Communication Windows – The 2-minute acknowledgment interval was adequate, but automated parallel notifications (text + badge buzz + overhead page) could reduce latency.\n3. Physical Sweep Efficiency – The sweep covered five locations in three minutes; mapping these as predefined high-probability zones would speed future searches.\n4. Data Continuity – Because each robot returned structured JSON, downstream agents consumed outputs without reformatting. Adhering to strict schema discipline minimized integration errors.\n5. Display Relevance – Including ‘Issue Reported’ in the display’s footer immediately signaled team readiness; this pattern should become standard for triage bays.\n6. Leadership Oversight – Prompt supervisory decisions (launching recovery steps and reassigning HCWs) kept the workflow moving and avoided escalation.\n7. Preventive Measure – Proactive status polling of assigned HCWs (e.g., periodic presence pings) before emergencies could further mitigate initial no-show scenarios.\n\nOverall, the crew adapted effectively to dynamic conditions, leveraged multi-agent capabilities, and sustained patient-centric responsiveness."
