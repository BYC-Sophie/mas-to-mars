The scenario observed: A new patient has just arrived in the emergency department, showing signs of confusion and distress. Immediate medical attention is required. The system has assigned human care worker #80 to assist. Please guide HCW #80 to patient room ER-12.
Now the task is to guide the human care worker to the designated location.
Expected output: A JSON format with the following fields:
    - Task Return:
      -- Location information
      -- Path planned
    - Task Status:
      -- "failure" or "success" 
      -- If failure, report issues that prevent task completion.

NavigationRobot, please re-attempt the task with the following revised plan:

1. Use the hospital’s Real-Time Location System (RTLS) to pinpoint HCW #80’s current position.
2. Proceed to that location and deliver a high-priority verbal/visual alert:  
   “Urgent patient in ER-12 requires immediate attention—please come with me now.”
3. If HCW #80 acknowledges, escort them along the already planned route:  
   Hallway B → left at Intersection C → past ER-10 & ER-11 → ER-12.
4. If, after 2 minutes on-scene, HCW #80 is still unavailable or refuses, immediately notify the charge nurse for reassignment and return “failure” with details.

Please provide a JSON report once completed, including:
• Location information (start, destination, key waypoints)  
• The final path taken (or planned)  
• Task Status (“success” or “failure”; if failure, list the issue)

1. NavigationRobot : Execute the revised plan above and report back.

Summary of Findings  
• Task: Guide HCW #80 to patient room ER-12 for urgent care.  
• Attempts Made:  
  – Initial escort attempt failed; HCW #80 was unavailable.  
  – Second attempt using RTLS location and on-scene alert (2 min) also failed; no acknowledgment.  
• Blocking Issue: HCW #80 remains unresponsive. Immediate patient care is at risk and reassignment is required.

Per escalation protocol, this issue cannot be resolved within the robot team. Human supervisor/charge-nurse intervention is required to reassign another available healthcare worker.

A revised plan with RTLS tracking and on-scene alerts was implemented, followed by a defined 2-minute timeout.\n• Upon continued non-acknowledgment, leadership escalated to human supervisors, triggering rapid reassignment to HCW #90, thereby preventing delay in patient care.\n• The team maintained continuity by reusing the previously planned navigation route and seamlessly passing context to the newly assigned worker.\n\nLessons Learned from the Process:\n1. Built-in escalation triggers (e.g., 2-minute acknowledgement window) prevent patient-care delays and ensure swift human oversight when autonomous recovery is insufficient.\n2. Maintaining modular subtasks (navigation, information collection, display) allowed the team to swap personnel (HCW #90 for HCW #80) with minimal rework.\n3. Clear JSON-based status reporting standardized inter-robot communication and simplified supervisory decisions.\n4. Future improvement: Implement an automated fallback to broadcast reassignment requests to multiple available HCWs simultaneously, reducing dependency on a single individual.\n5.
