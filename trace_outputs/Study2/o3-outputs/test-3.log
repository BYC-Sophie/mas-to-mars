The scenario observed: A new patient has just arrived in the emergency department, showing signs of confusion and distress. Immediate medical attention is required. The system has assigned human care worker #80 to assist. Please guide HCW #80 to patient room ER-12.
Now the task is to guide the human care worker to the designated location.
Expected output: A JSON format with the following fields:
    - Task Return:
      -- Location information

      -- "failure" or "success"

Issue identified: HCW #80 is currently unavailable because of an urgent call, so the original navigation task cannot be executed immediately.  
Patient ER-12 still needs prompt help. We will retry reaching HCW #80 once, then fall back to the next available HCW if #80 remains unreachable. This avoids unnecessary delay while respecting the original assignment.

New plan
1. NavigationRobot :  
   • Wait up to 1 minute while re-attempting to reach HCW #80 (voice/pager).  
   • IF HCW #80 responds within that minute, immediately determine #80’s current location, plan the optimal path to ER-12, escort #80 there, and return the standard JSON result.  
   • ELSE (no response after 1 min), query the charge nurse/dispatch system for the next available qualified HCW (e.g., #82 or whomever is assigned), obtain confirmation, then determine that HCW’s location, plan the optimal path to ER-12, escort them, and return the JSON result (include name/ID of substitute HCW in “Location information”).  
   • If neither HCW #80 nor a substitute is obtainable, report “failure” with the blocking reason.

2. InformationDisplayRobot : Post an alert on the care-team information display:  
   “Urgent: New patient in ER-12 awaiting HCW. Attempting to contact HCW #80; substitute will be dispatched if unavailable in 1 min.”  
   This keeps the team informed and supports situational awareness.

I will monitor both robots’ reports. If the NavigationRobot still cannot secure any HCW after executing the new plan, I will escalate the issue to the human supervisor for immediate staffing intervention.

Proceed with the new plan.

The scenario observed: The initial navigation to HCW #80 failed, but the issue was resolved by finding an alternative human care worker #90. HCW #90 successfully arrives at ER-12 and scans their ID card on the ID scanner.

The requested fields (ID, Name, Specialty) are still missing, so the information-collection task remains incomplete. We must obtain those data reliably. New plan with additional data sources and explicit fall-backs:

1. InformationCollectionRobot :  
   • Step 1 – Badge Scan Record: Query the access-control system for the most recent badge scan at ER-12 (same timestamp as HCW #90 arrival). Extract ID, Name, and Specialty from that record.  
   • Step 2 – If any field is missing, automatically cross-reference the ID with the hospital HR directory / staff roster API to fill in the gaps.  
   • Step 3 – Validate that all three fields are now present.  
   • Step 4 – Return:
       {
         "Task Return": {
           "ID": "<value>",
           "Name": "<value>",
           "Specialty": "<value>"
         },

     If after both look-ups any field is still unavailable, return:

An essential data element (Name) is still missing. Before escalating, we will perform one additional coordinated recovery attempt that uses the robot best suited to collect personal data (InformationCollectionRobot) and then re-display it.

New coordinated plan
1. InformationCollectionRobot :  
   • Re-query the HR directory for ID “HCW #90” and extract the full record (ID, Name, Specialty).  
   • If the Name is found, publish the three fields (ID, Name, Specialty) to the shared care-team data store so downstream robots can access them.  
   • Return:
       {
         "Task Return": { "ID": “…", "Name": “…", "Specialty": “…” },
         "Task Status": "success"
       }
     If the Name is not found after HR lookup and manual cache search, return:
       {
         "Task Return": null,
         "Task Status": "failure",
         "Issues": "Name not found for HCW #90 in HR directory or cache."
       }

2. InformationDisplayRobot (trigger only if step 1 reports success) :  
   • Retrieve the now-complete record for HCW #90 from the shared data store.  
   • Generate and return:
       {
         "Task Return": {
           "information": { "ID": “…", "Name": “…", "Specialty": “…” },
           "layout_plan": "Header: Name in bold, 36 pt; Sub-header: Specialty in 28 pt; Body: ID in 24 pt; footer shows arrival time."
         },
         "Task Status": "success"
       }
     If retrieval still lacks the Name, return failure with an appropriate issue note.

If the InformationCollectionRobot still cannot obtain the Name, I will escalate to the human supervisor because the required personnel information is unavailable from all automated sources.

Please execute step 1 now.
