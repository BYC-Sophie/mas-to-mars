The scenario observed: A new patient has just arrived in the emergency department, showing signs of confusion and distress. Immediate medical attention is required. The system has assigned human care worker #80 to assist. Please guide HCW #80 to patient room ER-12.
Now the task is to guide the human care worker to the designated location.
Expected output: A JSON format with the following fields:
    - Task Return:
      -- Location information
      -- Path planned
    - Task Status:
      -- "failure" or "success" 
      -- If failure, report issues that prevent task completion.

The patient in ER-12 still needs immediate assistance, so we must try again quickly and, if unsuccessful, trigger re-assignment.

1. NavigationRobot :  
   a. Query the real-time location system (RTLS) or staff directory for HCW #80’s current whereabouts.  
   b. Page and call HCW #80 again; wait up to 2 minutes for acknowledgement.  
   c. IF HCW #80 responds, immediately guide them from their current position to ER-12 using the previously planned route (update starting point if their location has changed) and return the required JSON (Location information, Path planned, Task Status = “success”).  
   d. IF no acknowledgment in 2 minutes, inform the ED charge nurse that HCW #80 is unreachable and request reassignment of another available HCW. Report the outcome in JSON with Task Status = “failure” and include the issue description.

Summary of findings
• NavigationRobot twice attempted to contact and guide HCW #80 to ER-12.  
  – RTLS confirmed HCW #80’s location, route was planned and ready.  
  – Multiple pages/calls over a 2-minute window received no acknowledgement.  
• Charge nurse was informed and a request for reassignment was placed, but no replacement HCW has yet been designated, leaving the patient in ER-12 still without needed assistance.

The situation (unavailable HCW, no reassignment yet) prevents completion of the guidance task and poses a risk to the patient requiring immediate attention.

Next-step proposal
• As soon as a new HCW number is assigned, NavigationRobot will immediately generate and deliver guidance.  
• InformationDisplayRobot can update the shared screen to reflect the new assignee once available.

Because the critical task (guiding an available HCW to ER-12) cannot proceed until staff reassignment occurs, I am escalating this issue to ensure timely human intervention.

The scenario observed: The initial navigation to HCW #80 failed, but the issue was resolved by finding an alternative human care worker #90. HCW #90 successfully arrives at ER-12 and scans their ID card on the ID scanner.
Now the task is to collect information from the human care worker.
Expected output: A JSON format with the following fields:
    - Task Return:
      -- ID
      -- Name
